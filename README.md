#TYPO3 Menu for Magento

So somebody decided to do CMS-y stuff with TYPO3 and you need to somehow rebuild the navigation from TYPO3 in your Magento 2 Theme? No worries. I got you, fam!

So in the directory 'typo3' you'll find some TYPOSCRIPT wizardry to create a JSON representation of your Pagetree in TYPO3. You'll need to implement this into your custom template somehow. I am not the greates TYPO3 dev, so you're a bit on your own here.

##coming soon
The Magento 2 Plugin, that will enable you to put the TYPO3 Navigation somewhere.
